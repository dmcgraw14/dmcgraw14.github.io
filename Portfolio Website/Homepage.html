        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Dominic McGraw. I am a first-year student at Dundee University, studying computing science. I am 18 years-old and have lived in Dundee all my life. I started my education at Eastern primary school in Broughty Ferry. After Primary school I started secondary school at Grove Academy, also in Broughty Ferry. However, I only attended Grove academy for a short four month from the start of the school year until the Christmas holidays. When we went back to school after the holidays I started at a new school. I started at St Johns RC High School.</p>
      <br>
        <p>It was during my time at St Johns RC High School when I found my interest in software and web development. I had always enjoyed solving puzzles and subjects like maths. Computing Science was always a great way to implement the solutions to problems. Getting into my later years at secondary I focused in on subjects like Maths, Computing Science and Physics. Before in my final year doing my advanced Highers in Maths and Computing Science.</p>
      <br>
        <p>After Secondary I decided to take a year out before going to university. During this year I worked at the Apex Hotel at city quay. This was not the funniest year Iâ€™ve had to say the least. Although it did show me how much I looked forward to starting university.</p>
