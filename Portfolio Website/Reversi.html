      <h3>Reversi</h3>
      <h5>Introduction to Software Development Project</h5>
      <div class="project_text grid-60">
        <p>Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned colour facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's colour that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's colour are turned over to the current player's colour.</p>
      <br>
        <p>The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your colour when the last playable empty square is filled.</p>
      <br>
        <p>I implemented this game using Java, and Java Swing for the user interface. We set about this project in a team to plan and design before splitting up and implementing it individually. In the pictures you can see how the user interface looked before then you can see the progression as I used Java Swing.</p>
